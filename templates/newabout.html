        <p align="right"><em>Customizable Latin and Greek Vocabulary Lists</em></p>
        <div> <strong>The Bridge</strong> enables students and instructors to generate customized vocabulary lists from its database of Greek and Latin textbooks and texts. A list might include all the vocabulary from a core list, an ancient text, or a textbook. But users can focus on a selection of a list or work and also customize their lists to take into account textbooks that they have used, core lists they have mastered, and texts they have already read. Or you can create a list that shows words that appear in two or more lists, textbooks, and texts. For each word, you have the option to add the part of speech or links to <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu">Logeion</a>. These lists can then be filtered to focus on one or more parts of speech, among other options, and then printed or downloaded in a variety of formats.</div>

        <p>The Bridge was first developed by Julie Ta (Haverford &#8217;16) and Blair Rush (Haverford &#8217;16) in the summer of 2014. Significant revisions were begun in the summer and fall of 2015 by Jack Raisel (Haverford &#8217;17) and Julie Ta, and completed in the summer of 2017 by Byron Biney (Swarthmore '19) and Dylan Emery (Haverford &#8217;18). Additional administrative, technical, and logistical support was provided by Laurie Allen (Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Services), Michael Zarafonetis (Digital Scholarship Librarian), Andy Janco (Digital Scholarship Librarian), Margaret Schaus (Lead Research and Instruction Librarian), Adrienne Lucas (University of Delaware), Jennifer Rajchel (Assistant Director, Tri-Co Digital Humanities), and Archana Kaku (Tri-Co Digital Humanities Program Coordinator, Bryn Mawr College). Initial data for The Bridge have been compiled by Florencia Foxley (HC &#8217;13), Emma Mongoven (&#8217;14), Vanessa Felso (Bryn Mawr College &#8217;15), and Carman Romano (HC &#8217;16). Additional collaborators are listed on the &quot;<a href="http://iris.haverford.edu/bridge/details-about-texts/">Details About Texts</a>&quot;. Data for some ancient texts were generously provided by the <a href="http://www.cipl.ulg.ac.be/Lasla/index.html">Laboratoire d&#8217;Analyse Statistique des Langues Anciennes</a> at the Université de Liège and <a href="https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/">The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebanking Project</a>. The development of The Bridge was made possible by the financial support of Haverford College (2014-2017), a <a href="http://caas-cw.org/wp/caas/grants/">Program Grant from the Classical Association of the Atlantic States</a> (2015)  a Mellon Digital Humanities Grant (2014-2015). </p>
